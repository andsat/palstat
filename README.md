Palace Chat Server Status Generator

This was written some time around 2003 during the demise of Communities.com, the soon-to-be-bankrupt owner of The Palace 2D visual chat.

It was written as a replacement for the ancient (c. 1998) Java applet "palAdminStat" included with the Palace Server.

This code sends a user to a Palace Server to gather information and disconnect without joining a room or setting a username.

Basically a half-connection, long enough to get information.

Use this as a simple protocol example for The Palace Visual Chat. Note that previous knowledge of the protocol is required. More information on The Palace is available on the website of Jim "jbum" Bumgardner, the creator of the software:
