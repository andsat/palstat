Palace Chat Server Status Generator

This was written some time around 2003 during the demise of Communities.com, the soon-to-be-bankrupt and owner of The Palace 2D visual chat.

It was written as a replacement for the ancient (c. 1998) Java applet "palAdminStat" included with the Palace Server.

This code sends a user to a Palace Server to gather information and disconnect without joining a room or setting a username.

Basically a half-connection, long enough to get information.

Use this as an example of how simple the Palace protocol actually is. Note that previous knowledge of the protocol is required.

More information on the protocol can be found in the developers toolkit or the old source code, which can be found at:
